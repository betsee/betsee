# --------------------( SYNOPSIS                          )--------------------
# Project-wide packager-agnostic configuration. Unlike all other top-level
# configuration files (e.g., "setup.py", "MANIFEST.in") specific to some
# utility in Python's package management ecosystem (e.g., "pip", "setuptools"),
# this file strictly conforms to a standards-compliant PEP and hence
# generically applies to *ALL* such utilities.
#
# Welcome to project distribution hell, where only twenty distinct files in
# twenty distinct formats suffice to distribute a single project.
