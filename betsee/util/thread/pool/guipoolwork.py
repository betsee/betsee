class QBetseeThreadPoolWorker(QRunnable):
    '''
    Low-level **pooled worker** (i.e., thread-safe object implementing
    generically startable, pausable, resumable, and stoppable business logic
    isolated to a dedicated thread by a parent :class:`QThreadPool` container).

    Lifecycle
    ----------
    The caller remains responsible for the lifecycle of this worker, an
    intentional design decision with several notable implications:

    * The caller *must* preserve a reference to this worker for the duration of
      the work performed by this worker (i.e., the :meth:`run` method), ideally
      as an instance variable of the class calling the
      :func:`guipoolthread.start_worker` function directing this work.
      Conversely, a local variable fails to satisfy this requirement. Lastly,
      note that preserving a reference to this reference is effectively
      mandatory for other unrelated reasons: notably, pausing, resuming, and
      stopping work by calling those methods on the reference to this worker.
    * If this is a **one-shot worker** (i.e., run only once by a single thread)
      rather than **recyclable worker** (i.e., run multiple times by multiple
      threads), the caller should connect the :attr:`signals.finished` signal
      of this worker to a slot nullifying the aforementioned reference to this
      worker. Failure to do so will result in a minor memory leak.

    By Qt default, workers are implicitly deleted by their parent
    :class:`QThreadPool` container immediately on returning from the
    :meth:`run` method. Although a sensible default for C++-based workers for
    whom lifecycle management is a non-trivial concern, Python-based workers
    suffer no such constraints and introduces numerous issues; in particular,
    allowing Qt to implicitly delete workers on worker completion:

    * Prevents callers from optionally recycling otherwise recyclable workers.
    * Introduces race conditions between the continued usage of these workers
      from Python callables from differing threads (e.g., slots, event
      handlers) and the deletion of these workers by Qt itself from the worker
      thread. As :class:`QRunnable` instances, workers provide *no* equivalent
      to the :attr:`QObject.destroyed` signal for deterministically responding
      to worker deletion. The closest equivalents are:

      * The custom :attr:`signals.finished` signal, which typically (but *not*
        necessarily) coincides with worker deletion.
      * The optional Python **finalizer** (i.e., special ``__del__()`` method)
        and corresponding optional ``callback`` parameter performing similar
        finalization accepted by the standard :func:`weakref.ref` function,
        which approximately but *not* exactly coincide with worker deletion and
        which impose unreasonable constraints on implementation -- notably, the
        inability to propagate or handle exceptions raised by these callables:

            Exceptions raised by the callback will be noted on the standard
            error output, but cannot be propagated; they are handled in exactly
            the same way as exceptions raised from an objectâ€™s ``__del__()``
            method.

        Exception propagation and logging is central to sane and deterministic
        application behaviour. Any small benefit gained from handling worker
        deletion via such a callback would surely be dwarfed by the grosser
        detriment of being unable to properly handle exceptions.

      In either case, there would exist a slice of time in which Qt has
      implicitly deleted a worker but Python has yet to be notified of that
      implicit deletion and hence continue to operate under the inappropriate
      assumption of that worker's continued existence. Race conditions ensue.
      Technically, these conditions could be obviated by:

      * Explicitly creating weak rather than strong references to workers.
      * Wrapping each access to such a weak reference in a
        ``try: ... except ReferenceError: ...`` block handling this race.

      In practice, however, the maintenance burden of doing so substantially
      exceeds the negligible benefit of permitting Qt to delete workers.

    Thread Affinity
    ----------
    All attributes of instances of this class reside in the original thread in
    which this worker was instantiated *except* the following, which reside in
    a dedicated thread of a parent :class:`QThreadPool` container and hence are
    guaranteed to be thread-safe by definition:

    * The :meth:`run` method.
    * All local objects instantiated by the :meth:`run` method.

    All other attributes should be assumed to *not* be thread-safe. These
    attributes may nonetheless be rendered thread-safe by either:

    * Locking access to these attributes behind Qt-specific mutual exclusion
      primitives and context managers (e.g., :class:`QMutexLocker`).
    * Defining these attributes to be Qt-specific atomic types (e.g.,
      :class:`QAtomicInt`). Since no Python-based Qt framework (including
      PySide2) exposes these types, this approach applies *only* to C++-based
      Qt applications. Ergo, atomic types are currently inapplicable. See below
      for further details.

    Signal-slot Connections
    ----------
    This class subclasses the :class:`QRunnable` interface rather than the
    standard :class:`QObject` base class. This has various real-world
    implications. In particular, subclasses of this class *cannot* directly
    participate in standard queued signal-slot connections and hence should
    define neither signals nor slots.

    Instead, to emit signals from this worker to slots on objects residing in
    other threads:

    * Declare a separate :class:`QObject` subclass defining these signals.
    * Instantiate an instance of this subclass in the parent thread in which
      this worker is instantiated.
    * Pass this instance to this worker's :meth:`__init__` method.

    By definition, this worker *cannot* receive any signals emitted from any
    objects residing in other threads as conventional slots. Instead:

    * Define each such slot as a simple method of this subclass. Since this
      method will be run from the other thread in which the object calling this
      method resides rather than the pooled thread in which this worker
      resides, this method's body *must* protectively guard access to instance
      variables via Qt-specific mutual exclusion primitives. While numerous
      primitives exist, the following maximize thread-safety in common edge
      cases (e.g., exceptions) and hence are strongly preferred:

      * :class:`QReadLocker` and :class:`QWriteLocker`, context managers
        suitable for general-purpose use in guarding access to variables
        safely:

        * Readable from multiple concurrent threads.
        * Writable from only a single thread at a time.

      * :class:`QMutexLocker`, a context manager suitable for general-purpose
        use in guarding access to variables safely readable *and* writable from
        only a single thread at a time.

    Lastly, note that Qt defines numerous atomic types publicly accessible to
    C++ but *not* Python applications (e.g., :class:`QtCore::QAtomicInt`). In
    theory, these types could be leveraged as an efficient alternative to the
    primitives listed above. In practice, these types have yet to be exposed
    via any Python Qt framework (PyQt5, PySide2, or otherwise) and hence remain
    a pipe dream at best.

    Versus QtConcurrent
    ----------
    The API published by this superclass bears a mildly passing resemblance to
    the API published by the QtConcurrent framework -- notably, the
    :class:`PySide2.QtCore.QFuture` class. Unfortunately, the latter imposes
    extreme constraints *not* imposed by this superclass.

    The QtConcurrent framework only provides a single means of multithreading
    arbitrary long-running tasks: :func:`PySide2.QtConcurrent.run`. The
    official documentation publicly admits the uselessness of this function:

        Note that the :class:`PySide2.QtCore.QFuture` returned by
        :func:`PySide2.QtConcurrent.run` does not support canceling, pausing,
        or progress reporting. The :class:`PySide2.QtCore.QFuture` returned can
        only be used to query for the running/finished status and the return
        value of the function.

    One enterprising StackOverflower `circumvented this constraint`_ by
    defining a robust C++ :class:`PySide2.QtCore.QFuture` analogue supporting
    canceling, pausing, and progress reporting. Sadly, this analogue requires
    C++-specific facilities unavailable under Python, including:

    * **Templating.** Since the :class:`PySide2.QtCore.QFuture` API is
      templated, all analogues of that API are also necessarily templated.
    * Private, undocumented Qt APIs (e.g., ``QFutureInterface``,
      ``QFutureInterfaceBase``).

    Ergo, the QtConcurrent framework is largely inapplicable in Python and
    certainly inapplicable for multithreading arbitrary long-running tasks.

    .. _circumvented this constraint:
       https://stackoverflow.com/a/16729619/2809027

    Versus QThread + QObject
    ----------
    The API published by this superclass also bears a passing resemblance to
    various third-party APIs duplicating the common worker-thread Qt model.
    These models typically:

    * Define one or more application-specific **worker types** (i.e.,
      :class:`QObject` subclasses performing long-running tasks to be
      multithreaded).
    * Instantiate these subclasses as local worker objects.
    * Instantiate a local :class:`QThread` object.
    * Move these workers into this thread via the :class:`QObject.moveToThread`
      method.
    * Start this thread by calling the :class:`QThread.start` method.
    * Start, pause, resume, cancel, and restart these workers thread by
      emitting signals connected to slots defined on these workers.

    As with the aforementioned QtConcurrent framework, this approach
    fundamentally works in C++ but fails in Python. For unknown reasons, the
    :class:`QObject.moveToThread` method silently fails to properly move worker
    objects in entirety from the main thread into the worker thread. Slots
    defined on workers claim to run from within their worker thread but instead
    run from within the main thread, as trivially observed with logging.

    Ergo, the worker-thread Qt model is also largely inapplicable in Python and
    certainly inapplicable for multithreading arbitrary long-running tasks.

    Attributes (Public)
    ----------
    signals : QBetseeThreadPoolWorkerSignals
        Low-level collection of all public signals thread-safely emittable by
        the :meth:`run` method from within an arbitrary pooled thread possibly
        running *no* Qt event loop.

    Attributes (Private)
    ----------
    _thread : WeakRefType
        Weak reference to the :class:`QThread` instance wrapping the thread in
        which the :meth:`run` method is currently running if that method is
        currently running *or* ``None`` otherwise (i.e., if this worker either
        has yet to be started *or* has already finished).
    _worker_id : int
        0-based integer uniquely identifying this worker. This worker is
        guaranteed to be the *only* instance of this class assigned this
        integer for the lifetime of the current process. For disambiguity with
        the :func:`id` builtin, this variable is *not* named ``_id``.

    Attributes (Private: State)
    ----------
    _state : ThreadWorkerState
        Non-thread-safe current execution state of this worker. This state is
        non-thread-safe and hence should *only* be accessed by instantiating an
        exception-safe :class:QMutexLocker` context manager nonce passed the
        :attr:`_state_lock` primitive as the target of a ``with`` context.
    _state_lock : QMutex
        Non-exception-safe mutual exclusion primitive rendering the
        :meth:`state` property thread-safe. This primitive is
        non-exception-safe and hence should *never* be accessed directly. Each
        access to this primitive should be encapsulated by instantiating an
        exception-safe :class:QMutexLocker` context manager nonce as the
        target of a ``with`` context. Note that the context provided by the
        :class:QMutexLocker` class is *not* safely reusable and hence *must* be
        re-instantiated in each ``with`` context.
    _state_unpaused : QWaitCondition
        Thread synchronization primitive, permitting this worker when paused in
        its parent thread to indefinitely block until an object in another
        thread (e.g., the main thread) requests this worker be unpaused by
        waking up this primitive and hence this worker.

        Thread-safe psuedo-slot (i.e., non-slot method mimicking the
        thread-safe, push-based action of a genuine method) performing *all*
        subclass-specific business logic for this worker.

        This method works in a thread-safe manner safely pausable, resumable,
        and stoppable at any time from any object in any thread by directly
        calling the equally thread-safe :meth:`pause`, :meth:`resume`, and
        :meth :meth:`stop` methods.

        States
        ----------
        If this worker is in the :attr:`ThreadWorkerState.IDLE` state, this
        method changes to the :attr:`ThreadWorkerState.RUNNING` state and calls
        the subclass :meth:`_work` method.

        If this worker is in the :attr:`ThreadWorkerState.PAUSED` state, this
        method interprets this signal as a request to resume the work
        presumably previously performed by this worker by a prior signalling of
        this method.  To avoid reentrancy issues, this method changes to the
        :attr:`ThreadWorkerState.RUNNING` state and immediately returns.
        Assuming that a prior call to this method is still executing, that call
        will internally detect this change and resume working as expected.

        If this worker is in the :attr:`ThreadWorkerState.RUNNING` state, this
        method interprets this signal as an accidental attempt by an external
        caller to re-perform the work concurrently being performed by a prior
        call to this method. In that case, this method safely logs a non-fatal
        warning and immediately returns.

        See the :meth:`pause` method for commentary on these design decisions.

        Signals
        ----------
        This method emits the following signals (in order):

        * :attr:`signals.started` immediately *before* this method performs any
          subclass work.
        * :attr:`signals.failed` immediately *after* this method erroneously
          raises an unexpected exception while performing subclass work but
          *before* the :attr:`signals.finished` signal is emitted.
        * :attr:`signals.succeeded` immediately *after* all subclass work
          performed by this method successfully returns but *before* the
          :attr:`signals.finished` signal is emitted.
        * :attr:`signals.finished` immediately *after* this method performs all
          subclass work, regardless of whether that work succeeded or failed.

        Caveats
        ----------
        This method is *not* intended to be called directly. Only the parent
        thread pool of this worker is intended to call this method. External
        callers are advised to call the :func:`guipoolthread.start_worker`
        function instead.

        Subclasses should override the :meth:`_work` method rather than this
        method to perform subclass-specific business logic. This method is
        neither intended nor designed to be redefined by subclasses.

        otherwise. Ergo, completion is permanent.

        States

        **interruptible state** (i.e., a self-consistent internal state in
        which this subclass is fully prepared to be immediately terminated).

    def _halt_work_if_requested(self) -> None:
        '''
        Thread-safely either temporarily or permanently halt all
        subclass-specific business logic when requested to do so by external
        callers residing in other threads.

        This function is intended to be periodically called by the subclass
        :meth:`_work` function. Specifically, this method:

        * Raises an exception (expected to be caught by the :meth:`run` method
          calling the :meth:`_work` function) if either:

          * This worker has been externally signalled to stop (e.g., by an
            external call to the the :meth:`stop` method).
          * The thread of execution currently running this worker has been
            externally requested to stop (e.g., by calling the
            :func:`guithread.halt_thread_work` function).

        * Pauses this worker if this worker has been externally signalled to
          pause (e.g., by an external call to the the :meth:`pause` method).

        Caveats
        ----------
        This method imposes minor computational overhead and hence should be
        called intermittently (rather than overly frequently). Notably, each
        call to this method processes *all* pending events currently queued
        with this worker's thread -- including those queued for all other
        workers currently running in this thread.

        Raises
        ----------
        BetseePySideThreadWorkerStopException
            If this worker or this worker's thread of execution has been
            signalled or requested to be stopped.

        #
        # 1. The "_state_lock" *MUST* be acquired (i.e., locked) before calling
        #    the QWaitCondition.wait() method on this lock. This is the
        #    caller's responsibility, sadly.
        # 2. The QWaitCondition.wait() method immediately releases (i.e.,
        #    unlocks) this lock.
        # 3. The QWaitCondition.wait() method blocks indefinitely until the
        #    QWaitCondition.wakeOne() or wakeAll() methods are called -- in
        #    this case, by a call to our resume() method.

    business logic is encapsulated by a caller-defined callable at worker
    initialization time).

    This superclass is a convenience wrapper for the
    :class:`QBetseeThreadPoolWorker` superclass, simplifying usage in the
    common case of business logic definable by a single callable. Under the
    more general-purpose :class:`QBetseeThreadPoolWorker` API, each novel type
    of business logic must be implemented as a distinct subclass overriding the
    :meth:`_work` method to perform that specific logic. Under the less
    general-purpose API provided by this superclass, each such type of business
    logic is instead implemented as a simple callable (e.g., function, lambda)
    performing that specific logic; no new subclasses need be defined.
