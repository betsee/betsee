    Abstract base class of all low-level **non-pooled worker** (i.e.,
    thread-safe object implementing generically startable, pausable, resumable,
    and haltable business logic in a multithreaded manner intended to be adopted
    by the thread encapsulated by a :class:`QBetseeLoneThread` object)
    subclasses.

    By default, workers are recyclable and hence may be reused (i.e., have their
    :meth:`start` slots signalled) an arbitrary number of times within any
    arbitrary thread. Where undesirable, see the
    :cless:`QBetseeLoneThreadWorkerThrowawayABC` for an alternative superclass
    constraining workers to be non-recyclable.

    Caveats
    ----------
    This obsolete superclass has been superceded by the superior
    :class:`betse.util.thread.pool.guipoolwork.QBetseeThreadPoolWorker`
    superclass, whose :class:`QRunnable`-based API requires substantially less
    boilerplate.

    Attributes
    ----------
    _state : ThreadWorkerState
        Current execution state of this worker. For thread-safety, this state
        should *not* be externally accessed by objects residing in other
        threads. Doing so safely would require thread-safe mutual exclusion
        (e.g., with a dedicated :class:`QMutexLocker` context manager), which
        currently exceeds the mandate of this superclass.

        Caveats
        ----------
        This method intentionally accepts *no* passed parameters and hence
        cannot be passed a parent `QObject`. So, this worker is **unparented**
        (i.e., has no such parent). Why? Because this worker will be
        subsequently adopted into a different thread than the original thread in
        which this worker was instantiated. However, most candidate `QObject`
        parents of this worker would presumably reside in that original thread.
        Objects in different threads should typically *not* control the
        lifecycle of each other, as the parent of a child `QObject` does;
        doing so typically violates thread-safety. (That's bad.)

    #* Define a new "QBetseeLoneThreadWorkerStartArgsABC(QObject)" class in this

        Slot performing *all* subclass-specific business logic for this worker.

        This slot works in a thread-safe manner safely pausable and stoppable at
        any time (e.g., by emitting a signal connected to the :meth:`pause` or
        :meth:`stop` slots).

        States
        ----------
        If this worker is in the :attr:`ThreadWorkerState.IDLE` state, this
        slot changes to the :attr:`ThreadWorkerState.WORKING` state and calls
        the subclass :meth:`_work` method.

        If this worker is in the :attr:`ThreadWorkerState.PAUSED` state, this
        slot interprets this signal as a request to resume the work presumably
        previously performed by this worker by a prior signalling of this slot.
        To avoid reentrancy issues, this slot changes to the
        :attr:`ThreadWorkerState.WORKING` state and immediately returns.
        Assuming that a prior call to this slot is still executing, that call
        will internally detect this change and resume working as expected.

        If this worker is in the :attr:`ThreadWorkerState.WORKING` state, this
        slot interprets this signal as an accidental attempt by an external
        caller to re-perform the work concurrently being performed by a prior
        call to this slot. In that case, this slot safely logs a non-fatal
        warning and immediately returns.

        See the :meth:`pause` slot for commentary on these design decisions.

        Signals
        ----------
        This slot emits the following signals:

        * :attr:`started` immediately *before* this slot performs any
          subclass-specific business logic for this worker.
        * :attr:`finished` immediately *after* this slot performs all
          subclass-specific business logic for this worker.

        Caveats
        ----------
        Subclasses must override the :meth:`_work` method rather than this slot
        to perform subclass-specific business logic. This slot is neither
        intended nor designed to be overriden by subclasses.

        Design
        ----------
        Subclasses are required to redefine this method to perform this logic in

          externally requested to stop (e.g., by calling the
          :func:`guithread.halt_thread_work` function).

        Then the next such call to the :meth:`_halt_work_if_requested` method

        This function is intended to be periodically called by the subclass

    Equivalently, this is the superclass of all single-use, one-shot, one-time,

    however.

    Usage
    ----------
    Ideally, the :meth:`start` slot of each instance of this superclass should
    be signalled at most once. Immediately *after* performing all
    subclass-specific work via the :meth:`_work` method, this slot (in order):

    #. Emits the :attr:`finished` signal.
    #. Signals itself to be garbage-collected via the :meth:`deleteLater` slot.
    #. Returns.

    After returning from the :meth:`start` slot, all external references to this
    worker are effectively invalidated and hence equivalent to ``None``; no such
    worker may be safely used for *any* subsequent purposes.

        #faults on worker completion. Our intuitive suspicion is that the

        #to the deleteLater() slot, which doesn't expect to receive boolean

        #curiously. The solution, of course, would be to connect the "finished"
        #signal to a new slot accepting (and ignoring) a passed boolean and
        #simply calling the self.deleteLater() slot directly -- say:
        #
