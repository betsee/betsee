    '''
    Low-level **non-pooled worker thread"** (i.e., platform-portable, pure-Qt,
    :class:`QThread`-based wrapper running zero or more subordinate
    :class:`QBetseeLoneThreadWorkerABC`-based workers at a given time).

    Caveats
    ----------
    This obsolete superclass has been superceded by the superior
    :class:`betse.util.thread.pool.guipoolthread.QBetseeThreadPool` superclass,
    whose :class:`QRunnable`-based API requires substantially less boilerplate.

    The *only* methods of this subclass safely callable by external objects are
    the superclass :meth:`start` method and all subclass-specific public methods
    and properties. Other superclass methods (e.g., :meth:`exec`, :meth:`exit`,
    :meth:`quit`, :meth:`run`) should be considered unsafe for external usage
    and hence *never* called externally.

    Design
    ----------
    By design, this subclass intentionally does *not* override the superclass
    :meth:`run` method. While technically feasible (and even sadly encouraged by
    official documentation), doing so invites practical complications that
    *cannot* be trivially circumvented. These include:

    * The inability to run signalled slots of this subclass in this thread.
      Instead, each such slot is run in the thread from which that signal was
      emitted (e.g., the main event-handling thread). This severe constraint
      prohibits this thread from handling signals received from other threads,
      effectively rendering this thread useless for *most* real-world purposes.
    * The need to manually "spin up" a Qt event loop by calling the superclass
      :meth:`exec` method within the subclass :meth:`run` implementation.
    * The need to manually handle the threading lifecycle (e.g., pausing,
      resuming) with error-prone, low-level Qt primitives, including:
      * Mutual exclusions (e.g., :class:`QMutex`, :class:`QSemaphore`).
      * Thread-safe types (e.g., C++-style atomics).

    Instead, this subclass *strongly* recommends that
    :class:`QBetseeLoneThreadWorkerABC`-based workers be moved from the main
    event-handling thread to this thread by the :meth:`adopt_worker` method.

          :meth:`run` method).
        * Waits indefinitely for this thread's execution to gracefully
          terminate.

        Caveats
        ----------
        This method does *not* gracefully terminate any adopted worker of this
        thread running in this thread at the time of this call. Rather, such a
        worker will be non-gracefully terminated.

        The :meth:`terminate` method non-gracefully terminating this thread
        should *never* be called for any reason whatsoever. Doing so typically
        disrupts sane thread-safety in a manner inducing application-terminating
        segmentation faults. That's bad.

        The :meth:`exit` method gracefully terminating this thread's event loop
        should *never* be called either. This method's name is poorly chosen and
        bears no relation to actually exiting, quitting, or otherwise
        terminating this thread. Instead, this method merely undoes any prior
        call to the :meth:`exec` method starting this thread's event loop.

        The :meth:`quit` method is a perfect alias of the :meth:`exit` method
        and hence equally inadvisable for external use. Don't call it, either.

        In short, the :class:`QThread` API is a contemptible mess. Avoid it
        wherever possible; complain about it on StackOverflow and Reddit
        wherever impossible.

        This method does *not* classify these workers as instance variables of
        this object. This thread object is technically *not* a thread; this
        thread object is merely a high-level wrapper encapsulating a thread.

        ----------
        Avoid manually calling the :meth:`QBetseeLoneThreadWorkerABC.moveToThread`
