    Abstract base class of all widget-specific undo command subclasses,
    encapsulating both the application and restoration of the contents of a
    specific type of widget.

    Attributes
    ----------
    _id : int
        Integer uniquely identifying the concrete subclass implementing this
        abstract base class of this undo command.
    _widget : QBetseeEditWidgetMixin
        Application-specific widget operated upon by this undo command.
    _synopsis : str
        Human-readable string synopsizing the operation performed by this
        undo command, preferably as a single translated sentence fragment.
        This string is identical to that returned by the :meth:`actionString`
        method, but is stored as an instance variable purely for readability.

        Integer uniquely identifying the concrete subclass implementing this

        Our pure-C++ :class:`QUndoCommand` superclass requires this integer to
        transparently support **command compression** (i.e., automatic merging
        of adjacent undo commands of the same type)..

        '''
        Context manager notifying the widget associated with this undo command
        that this undo command is now being applied to it for the duration of
        this context.

        This context manager enables and then guaranteeably disables the
        :attr:`QBetseeEditWidgetMixin.is_undo_cmd_pushable` boolean even when
        fatal exceptions are raised, preventing :attr:`QBetseeEditWidgetMixin`
        subclass slots from recursively pushing additional undo commands onto
        the undo stack when already applying an undo command. Why? Because doing
        so induces infinite recursion, which is bad.

        Returns
        -----------
        contextlib._GeneratorContextManager
            Context manager notifying this widget as described above.

        Yields
        -----------
        None
            Since this context manager yields no values, the caller's ``with``
            statement must be suffixed by *no* ``as`` clause.
