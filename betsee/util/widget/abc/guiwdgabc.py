class QBetseeObjectMixin(object):
    '''
    Abstract base class of most application-specific Qt object subclasses.

    This class is suitable for use as a multiple-inheritance mixin. To preserve
    the expected method resolution order (MRO) semantics, this class should
    typically be inherited *first* rather than *last* in subclasses.

    Attributes (Private)
    ----------
    _is_initted : bool
        ``True`` only if this object's :meth:`init` method has been called.
    '''

    # ..................{ INITIALIZERS                       }..................
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs) -> None:
        '''
        Initialize this application-specific Qt object.

        Parameters
        ----------
        All parameters are passed as is to the superclass this mixin is mixed
        into (e.g., :class:`QObject` or a subclass thereof).

        Caveats
        ----------
        **Subclasses overriding this method should not attempt to accept
        subclass-specific parameters.** Due to the semantics of Python's
        method-resolution order (MRO), accidentally violating this constraint is
        guaranteed to raise non-human-readable exceptions at subclass
        instantiation time.

        Abstract base subclasses may trivially circumvent this constraint by
        defining abstract properties which concrete subclasses then define. When
        doing so, note that abstract methods should raise the
        :class:`BetseMethodUnimplementedException` exception rather than be
        decorated by the usual :meth:`abstractmethod` decorator -- which is
        *not* safely applicable to subclasses of this class.

        For example:

            >>> from betse.exceptions import BetseMethodUnimplementedException
            >>> @property
            ... def muh_subclass_property(self) -> MuhValueType:
            ...     raise BetseMethodUnimplementedException()
        '''

        # Initialize our superclass with all passed arguments.
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

        # Nullify all remaining instance variables for safety.
        self._is_initted = False

        # If this object has no name, default this object's name.
        if not self.obj_name:
            self.obj_name = _OBJ_NAME_DEFAULT


    def init(self) -> None:
        '''
        Finalize the initialization of this Qt object.

        This method is principally intended to simplify the implementation of
        subclasses overriding this method with subclass-specific finalization.

        Raises
        ----------
        BetseePySideEditWidgetException
            If this method has already been called for this object, preventing
            objects from being erroneously refinalized.
        '''

        # If this object has a meaningful name, log this initialization; else,
        # the subclass is expected to log this initialization.

            logs.log_debug('Initializing object "%s"...', self.obj_name)

        # exception.

                'Object "{}" already initialized.'.format(self.obj_name))

        # Record this object's initialization to now have been finalized.
        self._is_initted = True


    def init_if_needed(self, *args, **kwargs) -> None:
        '''
        Finalize the initialization of this object if needed (i.e., if this
        object's initialization has *not* already been finalized by a call to
        the :meth:`init` method).

        This method safely wraps the :meth:`init` method, effectively squelching
        the exception raised by that method when this object's initialization
        has already been finalized.

        Parameters
        ----------
        All parameters are passed as is to the :meth:`init` method if called.

        Set the Qt-specific name of this object to the unqualified name of this
        subclass, altered to comply with object name standards (e.g., from

        Specifically, this function (in order):

        #. Obtains the unqualified name of this subclass.
        #. Removes any of the following prefixes from this name:

           * ``QBetsee``, the string prefixing the names of all

        #. Converts this name from CamelCase to snake_case.
        #. Sets this object's name to this name.

        Design
        ----------
        This method is intentionally *not* called by the :meth:`__init__` method
        to set this object's name to a (seemingly) sane default. Why? Because
        numerous subclasses prefer to manually set this name. Unconditionally
        calling this method for every subclass would have the undesirable side
        effect of preventing this and other subclasses from detecting when the
        object name has yet to be set (e.g., via a comparison against the
        :data:`_OBJ_NAME_DEFAULT` default).
