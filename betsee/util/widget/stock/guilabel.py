class QBetseeLabelImage(QBetseeObjectMixin, QLabel):
    '''
    :mod:`QLabel`-based widget preserving the aspect ratio of the optional
    **pixmap** (i.e., in-memory image) added to this widget.

    By default, pixmaps added to :class:`QLabel` widgets are stretched to fit
    layout requirements -- commonly resulting in unappealing deformation of
    pixmaps added to these widgets. This derivative widget corrects this
    harmful behaviour by constraining the aspect ratio of this widget to be
    equal to the aspect ratio of the contained pixmap if any. To do so:

    * The width of this widget is always preserved as is.
    * The height of this widget is dynamically set to be the width of this
      widget multiplied by the aspect ratio of the contained pixmap if any,
      thus constraining the aspect ratio of this widget to be the same.

    This widget supports all image filetypes supported by standard Qt widgets.
    Specifically, all images whose filetypes are in the system-specific set
    returned by the
    :func:`betse.util.path.guifiletype.get_image_read_filetypes` function are
    explicitly supported.

    Caveats
    ----------
    This widget *must* be contained in a :class:`QScrollArea` widget.
    Equivalently, some transitive parent widget of this widget *must* be a
    :class:`QScrollArea` widget. If this is *not* the case when the
    :meth:`init` method finalizing this widget's initialization is called, that
    method explicitly raises an exception.

    Why? Because size hints for widgets residing outside of
    :class:`QScrollArea` widgets are typically silently ignored. This widget
    declares a size hint preserving the aspect ratio of its pixmap. If this
    size hint is silently ignored, this pixmap's aspect ratio will typically be
    silently violated. Since this widget type exists *only* to preserve this
    aspect ratio, this constitutes a fatal error.

    Recursion
    ----------
    There exists circumstantial online evidence that this widget can
    *effectively* induces infinite recursion in edge cases. Specifically, `it
    has been asserted elsewhere <recursion claim_>`__ that:

    * :meth:`QBetseeLabelImage.resizeEvent` calls
      :meth:`QBetseeLabelImage.setPixmap`.
    * :meth:`QBetseeLabelImage.setPixmap` calls
      :meth:`QLabel.setPixmap`.
    * :meth:`QLabel.setPixmap` calls :meth:`QLabel.updateLabel`.
    * :meth:`QLabel.updateLabel` calls :meth:`QLabel.updateGeometry`.
    * :meth:`QLabel.updateGeometry` may conditionally call
      :meth:`QLabel.resize` in edge cases.
    * :meth:`QLabel.resize` queues a new resize event for this label.
    * The Qt event loop processes this event by calling
      :meth:`QLabel.resizeEvent`, completing the recursive cycle.

    Technically speaking, no recursive cycle exists. Due to indirection
    introduced by event handling, the :meth:`QLabel.resize` and
    :meth:`QLabel.resizeEvent` methods are called in different branches of the
    call stack. Ergo, the above call chain should noticeably degrade
    application performance *without* fatally exhausting the stack. Sadly,
    since these methods are called sequentially rather than recursively,
    detecting and guarding against this edge case is infeasible. (It could be
    worse.)

    Practically speaking, we were unable to replicate this worst-case issue.
    Since we cannot replicate it, we cannot resolve it. We have elected instead
    to do nothing, accepting that this may become a demonstrable issue later.

    Attributes
    ----------
    _pixmap : (QPixmap, NoneType)
        Pixmap added to this widget by an external call to the
        :meth:`setPixmap` method if that method has been called *or* ``None``
        otherwise.
