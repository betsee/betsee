    # Yes, this actually removes this item from its parent tree. Why? Because
    # the high-level shiboken2.delete() function wraps the low-level C++
    # "delete" operator. Naturally, the "QTreeWidgetItem" class overrides the
    # "delete" operator to remove itself from its parent tree -- which, in C++,
    # is the established means of doing so. Ergo, this is the established means
    # of doing so in Python as well.

    * **Horizontal scrollbars,** automatically displaying horizontal scrollbars
      for all columns whose content exceeds that column's width. For
