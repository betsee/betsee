Tuple of all types whose instances are guaranteed to be losslessly coercible to
and from a :class:`PySide2.QtCore.QVariant` instance, a low-level union
analogue for primitive types and structures in Qt.

Equivalently, this tuple describes the set of all types whose instances may be
safely written to and read from a :class:`PySide2.QtCore.QSettings`-based
backing store of application-wide settings.
