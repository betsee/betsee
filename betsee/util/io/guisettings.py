Low-level :mod:`PySide2`-based application-wide settings facilities.

See Also
----------
:class:`PySide2.QtCore.QSettings`
    This class' official documentation is a comprehensive, comprehensible
    commentary on cross-platform, thread- and process-safe (de)serialization of
    application-wide settings. This documentation doubles as a human-readable
    FAQ and hence comes recommended, particularly for the Qt neophyte.

    Initialize the :class:`QSettings` class *before* the :func:`make` function
    is called elsewhere to instantiate that class.

    Specifically, this function establishes the default settings format
    subsequently accessed by the default :class:`QSettings` constructor as
    follows:

    * If the current platform is non-Cygwin Windows, request that settings be
      formatted in INI format to a physical file. By default, Windows settings
      are formatted as registery keys. Since the Windows registery is
      well-known to be fragile, insecure, and broken by design, this default
      remains sadly unfortunate but unfixable.
    * Else, request that settings be formatted in the format preferred by the
      current platform guaranteed to be a physical file.

    New :class:`QSettings` instance encapsulating all application-wide settings

    safely (de)serializable to and from a platform-, application-, and
    user-specific file guaranteed to be disambiguously unique.

    Design
    ----------
    By Qt design, repeatedly calling this function throughout the lifetime of
    this application is guaranteed to be efficient. Thus, callers are
    encouraged to do so rather than persist a permanent reference to the first
    :class:`QSettings` instance returned by this function.

    # * The "QCoreApplication.applicationName", "organizationName", and
    #   "organizationName" attributes previously set by the
    #   "betsee.util.psdapp" submodule.

    #   init() function.
