def get_app() -> QApplication:
    '''
    Initialized :class:`QApplication` singleton for this application if
    instantiated by a prior call to the :func:`init` function *or* raise an
    exception otherwise (i.e., if that function has yet to be called).

    Contrary to nomenclature, the :class:`QApplication` class confusingly
    subclasses the :class:`QGuiApplication` base class in a manner optimized
    for widgets. Ergo, the former is *always* preferable to the latter.

    Design
    ----------
    This function does *not* implicitly call the :func:`init` function if the
    :class:`QApplication` singleton has yet to be instantiated. While
    non-intuitive and arguably inconvenient, this is intentional. Implicitly
    calling that function would technically be trivial but invite subtle (and
    hence non-debuggable) issues; in particular, the order in which the
    :func:`init` and :func:`betse.lib.libs.reinit` methods are called is very
    significant and hence must *not* be left up to non-deterministic chance.

    Caveats (Exceptions)
    ----------
    Avoid directly accessing the low-level :attr:`PySide2.QtWidgets.qApp`
    global, which this higher-level function wraps. Since that global is
    typically ``None`` prior to the first call to the :func:`init` function,
    directly accessing that global sufficiently early in runtime may raise
    non-human-readable exceptions *or* induce low-level segmentation faults
    from Qt itself resembling:

        QWidget: Must construct a QApplication before a QWidget
        [1]    30475 abort      betsee -v

    In contrast, this function *always* raises human-readable exceptions.

    Caveats (Attributes)
    ----------
    Avoid attempting to add application-specific instance variables to the
    low-level :attr:`PySide2.QtWidgets.qApp` global returned by this function,
    as that global silently ignores all such attempts. While this constraint
    could technically be circumvented by globally persisting the
    :class:`QApplication` singleton created by the :func:`init` function as a
    module-scoped Python singleton, doing so would incur subtle issues of its
    own -- including complications in both garbage collection and accidental
    collision with standard Qt attributes.

    Returns
    ----------
    QApplication
        Initialized :class:`QApplication` singleton for this application.

    Raises
    ----------
    BetseePySideApplicationException
        If either:
        * The :func:`init` function has yet to be called.

    raised exception, various versions of PySide2 appear to erroneously
    initialize this singleton on first importation without our explicit
    consent. There isn't much we can do about it; this is the next best thing.

    If this singleton is _not_ explicitly destroyed, PySide2 raises the
    following exception on attempting to re-initialize another such singleton:
