    Absolute or relative pathname of a path interactively selected by the end
    user from a dialog displayed by calling the passed static getter of the
    :class:`QFileDialog` class (e.g., :func:`QFileDialog.getOpenFileName`)
    configured with the passed parameters if this user confirmed this dialog
    *or* ``None`` otherwise (i.e., if this user cancelled this dialog).

    Constraints
    ----------
    The type of path (e.g., directory, non-directory file) that this dialog
    permits the user to select is constrained *only* by the passed
    ``dialog_callable`` and ``dialog_options`` parameters.

    Similarly, whether the returned pathname is absolute or relative *and*
    whether the passed ``init_pathname`` parameter is required to be absolute
    or relative depends on which optional parameters are passed. Specifically:

    * If the ``parent_dirname`` parameter is non-``None``, the returned
      pathname will be either:

      * If this path resides in this parent directory or a subdirectory
        thereof, relative to the absolute dirname of this parent directory.
      * Else, absolute.

    * Else, the ``parent_dirname`` parameter is ``None``. In this case, the
      returned pathname will *always* be absolute.

    Likewise, if the ``init_pathname`` parameter is non-``None``:

    * If the ``parent_dirname`` parameter is also non-``None``, the
      ``init_pathname`` parameter may be either:

      * Relative, in which case ``init_pathname`` is interpreted as relative to
        the absolute dirname of this parent directory.
      * Absolute, in which case ``init_pathname`` is preserved as is.

    * Else, the ``parent_dirname`` parameter is ``None``. In this case, if the
      ``init_pathname`` parameter is:

      * A basename (i.e., contains no directory separator), ``init_pathname``
        is interpreted as relative to the absolute dirname of the **last
        selected directory** (i.e., the directory component of the pathname
        returned by the most recent call to this function).
      * Relative but *not* a basename (i.e., contains one or more directory
        separators), an exception is raised. While ``init_pathname`` could
        technically be interpreted as relative to the absolute dirname of the
        last selected directory as in the prior case, doing so would be
        unlikely to yield an existing directory and hence be practically
        guaranteed of raising an even less readable exception than this. Why?
        Since the last selected directory is an arbitrary directory,
        concatenating the arbitrary subdirectory defined by ``init_pathname``
        onto that directory is unlikely to yield a meaningful pathname.
      * Absolute, ``init_pathname`` is preserved as is.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dialog_callable : CallableTypes
        Static getter function of the :class:`QFileDialog` class to be called
        by this function (e.g., :func:`QFileDialog.getOpenFileName`).
    dialog_title : str
        Human-readable title of this dialog.
    dialog_options : (QFileDialog.Option, NoneType)
        **Bit field** (i.e., integer OR-ed together from mutually exclusive bit
        flags ala C-style enumeration types) of all :attr:`QFileDialog.Option`
        flags with which to configure this dialog. Defaults to ``None``, in
        which case this dialog defaults to the default configuration.
    init_pathname : StrOrNoneTypes
        Absolute or relative pathname of the path to initially display in this
        dialog. If this path is a directory, this directory is selected and the
        basename of the current selection is the empty string; else if this
        path is a file, this file is selected. If the directory component of
        this path does *not* exist, this directory component is implicitly
        reduced with a non-fatal warning to the last (i.e., most deeply nested)
        parent directory of this path that exists to ensure this dialog opens
        onto an existing directory. Defaults to ``None``, in which case the
        last selected directory is defaulted to.
    parent_dirname : StrOrNoneTypes
        Absolute pathname of the parent directory to select a path from.
        Defaults to ``None``, in which case no parental constraint is applied.
        See above for details.
    is_subpaths : bool
        ``True`` only if both the ``init_pathname`` parameter *and* the
        returned selected path are required to be children of the
        ``parent_dirname`` parameter (i.e., residing in either this directory
        itself *or* a subdirectory of this directory). Defaults to ``False``,
        in which case these paths may reside in any directory.
    label_to_filetypes : MappingOrNoneTypes
        Dictionary mapping from a human-readable label to be displayed for each
        iterable of related filetypes selectable by this dialog (e.g.,
        ``Images``) to that iterable (e.g., ``('jpg', 'png')``) if this dialog
        selects only files of specific filetypes *or* ``None`` otherwise. If
        this dialog only selects directories, this should be ``None``. Defaults
        to ``None``, in which case all paths of the requisite type (e.g., file,
        directory) regardless of filetype are selectable.

    Returns
    ----------
    StrOrNoneTypes
        Either:

        * If this dialog was confirmed, the absolute or relative pathname of
          the path confirmed by the end user.
        * If this dialog was cancelled, ``None``.
