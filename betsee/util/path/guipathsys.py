#FIXME: Actually implement this function as described. For simplicity, this
#function currently defers to *ALWAYS* return get_user_docs_dirname(). Instead:
#
#* Define a new set_path_dialog_init_pathname() setter in this submodule,
#  internally caching the passed pathname to the application's "QSettings" store.
#* In the get_path_dialog_init_pathname() function:
#  * If the application's "QSettings" store contains this previously cached
#    pathname *AND* this pathname still exists, return this pathname.
#  * Else, return get_user_docs_pathname().
#* In all select_*() functions defined by the "guidir" and "guifile" submodules:
#  * *BEFORE* the path dialog is displayed and the caller passed no
#    "init_pathname" parameter (i.e., if this parameter is "None"), externally
#    call this getter to obtain the default value of this "init_pathname"
#    parameter. <---- O.K., this is now done.
#  * *AFTER* the end user successfully confirms this path dialog, externally
#    call this setter.
#
#Not terribly arduous and quite useful. Make it so, please.
