    Absolute dirname of the **last existing directory compoment** (i.e.,
    longest trailing dirname whose directory actually exists) of the platform-
    and typically user-specific directory containing work-oriented files for

    Unlike the directory returned by the comparable
    :func:`get_user_documents_dirname` getter, this directory is guaranteed to
    exist on all platforms. For safety, this function does *not* create any
    additional directories; this function only finds an existing directory
    whose dirname most closely approximates that of the expected directory.

    Absolute dirname of the platform- and typically user-specific directory

    This directory is:

    * On both Linux and macOS, ``~/Documents``.
    * On Windows, ``C:/Users/{USERNAME}/Documents``.

    Caveats
    ----------
    **This directory is not guaranteed to exist on all platforms.** Under:

    * Microsoft Windows, this directory is guaranteed to exist.
    * macOS, this directory is guaranteed to exist.
    * Linux, this directory is *not* guaranteed to exist. This directory is
      likely to exist under Linux distributions complying with the
      freedesktop.org XDG Base Directory Specification. Even under these
      distributions, however, users remain freely at liberty to remove this
      directory. (Freedom has its price, does it not?)
