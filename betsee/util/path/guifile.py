    Parameters
    ----------
    All paremeters are passed as is to the :func:`guipath.select_path`

    Returns
    ----------
    StrOrNoneTypes
        Either:

        * If this dialog was confirmed, the absolute filename of this file.
        * If this dialog was cancelled, ``None``.

#FIXME: Ideally, this dialog would also display a preview of the currently
#selected image. Unfortunately, as the "QFileDialog" class provides no default
#means of doing so, doing so is non-trivial. Indeed, while existing solutions do
#exist, they exist only for Qt < 5.9. Qt >= 5.9 internally changed the widget
#substructure of "QFileDialog" widgets from a grid to vertical box layout. It
#remains unclear just how both layouts could reasonably be supported.
#Nonetheless, for Qt < 5.9 code in PyQt5 and C++ implementing this preview, see:

    For generality, this dialog recognizes all image filetypes recognized by
    the third-party image processing framework leveraged by BETSE itself:
    Pillow. (As BETSE defers to this framework for most low-level image I/O
    operations, deferring to the same framework guarantees parity with
    BETSE behaviour.)
