__version__
'''
Human-readable application version as a ``.``-delimited string.

For PEP 8 compliance, this specifier has the canonical name ``__version__``
rather than that of a typical global (e.g., ``VERSION_STR``).
'''


__version_info__
'''
Machine-readable application version as a tuple of integers.

For PEP 8 compliance, this specifier has the canonical name
``__version_info__`` rather than that of a typical global (e.g.,
``VERSION_PARTS``).
