    :class:`QSettings`-based object exposing all application-wide settings with
    cross-platform, thread- and process-safe slots permitting external callers

    on-disk backing store (e.g., an application- and user-specific dotfile).

    Attributes
    ----------
    _main_window : QBetseeMainWindow
        Main window for this application.

    :class:`betsee.gui.guisignal.QBetseeSignaler`
        Sibling class, whose signals are connected to this object's slots.

        # QMainWindow.restoreState() methods, QSettings documentation explicitly

        #
        #     "See Window Geometry for a discussion on why it is better to call
        #      QWidget::resize() and QWidget::move() rather than
        #      QWidget::setGeometry() to restore a window's geometry."
        #
        # Sadly, the "Window Geometry" article fails to actually discuss why the
        # QWidget.resize() and QWidget.move() methods are preferable to
        # QWidget.setGeometry() with respect to the main window. We do note,
        # however, that QWidget.setGeometry() documentation cautions:
        #
        #     "Warning: Calling setGeometry() inside resizeEvent() or
        #      moveEvent() can lead to infinite recursion."
        #
        # In the absence of compelling evidence, the current approach prevails.

        #FIXME: This logic currently appears to produce a bizarrely unusable
        #window on some platforms (e.g., Ubuntu Linux), presumably due to the
        #QBetseeMainWindow.resize_full() method and hence Qt.WindowFullScreen
        #mode being fundamentally broken in some respect -- possibly due to
        #Qt 5.6.x-specific issues resolved in subsequent Qt versions. In any

    #* Ideally incrementally during the application life cycle to prevent
    #  settings from being lost if the application fails to close gracefully.
    #  "QTimer" is probably our friends, here.
    #* By the QGuiApplication::commitDataRequest() slot, which Qt triggers on
    #  the current desktop session manager beginning a shutdown or suspend.
    #  However, note that:
    #  * This slot will also need to save unsaved data if any and that no
    #    interactive message box should be displayed to the user *UNLESS* this
    #    session manager explicitly permits such interaction. (Sigh.)
    #  * The QGuiApplication.setFallbackSessionManagementEnabled(False) method
    #    will need to be called to prevent fallback session management from
    #    interfering with this slot's behaviour.
    #  * Any concurrent operations (e.g., simulation running) will need to be
    #    temporarily halted until this application is restored. Failure to do so
    #    typically results in the OS killing this application. (Makes sense.) To
    #    respond to this application state change in a robust manner, it will
    #    probably be necessary to connect to the
    #    QGuiApplication::applicationStateChanged() slot.
