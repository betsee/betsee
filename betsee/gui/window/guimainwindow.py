Top-level classes defining this application's main window.

Caveats
----------
This submodule imports from the module whose fully-qualified name is given by
:attr:`metadata.MAIN_WINDOW_UI_MODULE_NAME`, an external top-level module
dynamically generated at runtime from XML-formatted files exported by the
external Qt Designer GUI and bundled with this application's codebase. Since
that module is *not* guaranteed to exist at application startup, this
submodule is safely importable only *after* the :mod:`betsee.lib.pyside2.cache.guipsdcache`
submodule has locally created and cached that module for the current user.

#FIXME: Consider permitting multiple simulations to be simultaneously open. The
#conventional means of doing so is the so-called Single Documentation Interface
#(SDI) approach, in which opening a new document opens a new distinct
#application window displaying that new document; open documents and hence
#windows may then be switched between via a "Windows" menu item listing all
#currently open documents. Supporting SDI would permit end users to run multiple
#simultaneous simulations, which only seems reasonable. As a PySide2-specific
#example, see the "pyside2-examples/examples/widgets/mainwindows/sdi/sdi.py"
#application. While incomplete, this application should serve as a simple
#starting point for implementing our own SDI. (It's only 295 lines!)
#FIXME: Actually, modern UI design strongly favours "QTabWidget"-style
#browser-based multiplicity -- and so do we. Ergo, classical window-style
#SDI- and MDI-based multiplicity are right out. That said, it shouldn't be
#terribly arduous to add a new top-level "QTabWidget" permitting multiple
#concurrently open simulations to be switched between. (Yeah, right.)

#FIXME: The status bar of the main window should be dynamically modified
#whenever *ANY* action (e.g., simulation opening or closure) is successfully
#completed. See to it, please.

#FIXME: The title of the main window should probably be dynamically modified on
#opening and closing a simulation configuration file to reflect both the
#basename of this file *AND* a character indicating whether this file has
#unsaved changes or not. Courtesy the official documentation for the
#"QWidget.windowModified" boolean property:
#
#    "The window title must contain a "[*]" placeholder, which indicates where
#     the '*' should appear. Normally, it should appear right after the file
#     name (e.g., "document1.txt[*] - Text Editor"). If the window isn't
#     modified, the placeholder is simply removed.
#
#     On some desktop platforms (including Windows and Unix), the application
#     name (from QGuiApplication::applicationDisplayName) is added at the end of
#     the window title, if set. This is done by the QPA plugin, so it is shown
#     to the user, but isn't part of the windowTitle string."
