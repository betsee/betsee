class QBetseeMainClipboard(QBetseeControllerABC):
    '''
    High-level **clipboarder** (i.e., :mod:`PySide2`-based object encapsulating
    all application clipboard state).

    This state includes:

    * Whether or not an application widget capable of receiving the interactive
      keyboard input focus is currently focused.
    * Whether or not the platform-specific system clipboard's plaintext buffer
      is currently empty (i.e., contains the empty string).

    Attributes
    ----------
    _widget_focused_if_any : QWidgetOrNoneTypes
        Widget currently receiving the interactive keyboard input focus if any
        *or* ``None`` otherwise. Ideally, the
        :func:`betsee.util.io.key.guifocus.get_widget_focused` getter would be
        called as needed to query for this widget rather than classifying this
        widget. Sadly, that getter appears to raise spurious exceptions on
        attempting to query for this widget when a toolbar button (notably, the
        copy, cut, or paste buttons) is clicked. Why? Presumably due to Qt
        subtleties in which the currently focused widget is temporarily
        defocused when a toolbar button is clicked -- regardless of that
        button's focus policy. In short, Qt issues.

    Attributes (Actions)
    ----------
    _action_copy : QAction
        Alias of the :attr:`QBetseeMainWindow.action_copy` action.
    _action_cut : QAction
        Alias of the :attr:`QBetseeMainWindow.action_cut` action.
    _action_paste : QAction
        Alias of the :attr:`QBetseeMainWindow.action_paste` action.

        Caveats
        ----------
        The slot is signalled in a somewhat deferred manner on macOS. To quote
        the documentation for the :attr:`QClipboard.dataChanged` signal:

             On macOS and with Qt version 4.3 or higher, clipboard changes made
             by other applications will only be detected when the application is
             activated.
