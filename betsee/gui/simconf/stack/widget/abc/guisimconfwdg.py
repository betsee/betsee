    Abstract base class of all **non-editable simulation configuration widget**
    (i.e., widget *not* interactively editing simulation configuration values
    stored in external YAML files) subclasses.

    Design
    ----------
    This class is suitable for use as a multiple-inheritance mixin. To preserve
    the expected method resolution order (MRO) semantics, this class should
    typically be subclassed *first* rather than *last* in subclasses.

    Attributes
    ----------
    _sim_conf : QBetseeSimConf
        High-level state of the currently open simulation configuration, which
        depends on the state of this low-level simulation configuration widget.

        '''
        Finalize the initialization of this widget.

        Design
        ----------
        Subclasses should typically override this method with a
        subclass-specific implementation that (in order):

        #. Calls this superclass implementation, which sets instance variables
           typically required by subclass slots.
        #. Connects all relevant signals and slots.

        Connecting these signals and slots earlier in the :meth:`__init__`
        method is *not* recommended, even for slots that Qt technically should
        *never* invoke at that time. Why? Because Qt actually appears to
        erroneously emit signals documented as emitted only by external user
        action (e.g., :meth:`QLineEdit.editingFinished`) on internal code-based
        action (e.g., startup construction of the main window).

        Parameters
        ----------
        sim_conf : QBetseeSimConf
            High-level state of the currently open simulation configuration.

        # Log this initialization *AFTER* storing this name.

            'Initializing non-editable widget "%s"...', self.obj_name)

        # Classify all passed parameters. Since the main window rather than this
        # state object owns this widget, retaining a reference to this state
        # object introduces no circularity and hence is safe. (That's nice.)
