        High-level :mod:`PySide2`-specific scalar value currently displayed by
        this scalar widget.

        Each subclass typically implements this Python property in terms of an
        unprefixed getter method of this widget (e.g., :meth:`QLineEdit.text`).

        Caveats
        ----------
        If this value is neither of the exact type(s) required by the simulation
        configuration alias associated with this widget *nor* of a similar type
        safely convertible into such a type, the subclass *must* redefine both
        the :meth:`_get_alias_from_widget_value` and
        :meth:`_get_widget_from_alias_value` methods to convert this value to
        and from such a type.

        This high-level value is purely :mod:`PySide2`-specific and hence
        distinct from the associated low-level scalar value defined by the
        simulation configuration. In particular, these two values are typically
        but *not* necessarily of the same type.

        For example, for the :class:`QBetseeSimConfEnumComboBox` subclass:

        * The high-level :meth:`QBetseeSimConfEnumComboBox.widget_value`
          property returns an integer (i.e., the 0-based index of the currently
          selected item in that combo box).
        * The low-level :meth:`QBetseeSimConfEnumComboBox._sim_conf_alias.get`
          getter returns the enumeration member corresponding to this item.

        ``set``-prefixed setter method of this widget (e.g.,
        :meth:`QLineEdit.setText`).

        Caveats
        ----------
        To avoid infinite recursion, the superclass rather than subclass
        implementation of this setter method should typically be called
        (e.g., ``super().setText()`` rather than ``self.setText()``). For the
        :class:`QBetseeSimConfLineEdit` subclass, for example, erroneously
        calling this subclass implementation would ensure that:

        #. On each call to the :meth:`setValue` method...
        #. Which pushes an undo command onto the undo stack...
        #. Whose :meth:`QUndoCommand.redo` method is called by that stack...
