'''
High-level **simulation configurator** (i.e., :mod:`PySide2`-based object
both displaying *and* modifying external YAML-formatted simulation
configuration files) functionality.
'''

#FIXME: Either this or a subordinate "QObject" should routinely detect
#simulation configuration desynchronization (i.e., external changes to the
#on-disk YAML file underlying the currently open simulation configuration if
#any) and interactively query the current user to either:
#
#* Discard all in-GUI changes to this configuration and reload this
#  configuration from disk.
#* Preserve all in-GUI changes to this configuration by ignoring these external
#  changes, thus overwriting these changes on the next save.
#
#To do so, we'll need to track the current mtime of this file with a
#"QFileSystemWatcher" instance as follows:
#
#* Define a new resync_file() slot of this class accepting a single "str"
#  argument: the absolute filename of the watched file that was modified. In
#  this case, that will be the top-level YAML file. Naturally, this slot will
#  perform the bulk of the logic pertaining to resynchronization. Note that
#  we'll need to explicitly test whether this file still exists or not in this
#  slot, as it may have been moved away or removed entirely.
#* In the __init__() and/or init() methods of this class:
#  * Create a new "_path_watcher" variable of type "QFileSystemWatcher".
#  * Connect the fileChanged() signal of this variable.
#* In the set_filename() slot:
#  * When a new simulation configuration is opened (i.e., "filename" is
#    non-empty), call the "self._path_watcher.addPath(filename)" method.
#  * When an open simulation configuration is closed (i.e., "filename" is
#    empty), call the "self._path_watcher.removePath(filename)" method.
#
#Note also that files can be moved and removed from disk. If the
#on-disk YAML file underlying the currently open simulation configuration no
#longer exists at any point (e.g., due to being externally removed), what is the
#sanest response? Should we simply ignore this case? Doing so will simply
#silently rewrite this file to disk on the next save, which seems reasonably
#sane. In other words, the noop-based lazy approach may be the correct approach.

    Attributes (Public)
    ----------
    p : Parameters
        High-level simulation configuration encapsulating a low-level
        dictionary parsed from an even lower-level YAML-formatted file. By
        design, this object is guaranteed to be a **singleton** (i.e., remain
        the same object for the lifetime of this application).
    undo_stack : QBetseeUndoStackSimConf
        Undo stack for the currently open simulation configuration if any *or*
        the empty undo stack otherwise.

    Attributes (Private: Non-widgets)
    ----------
    _is_dirty : bool
        ``True`` only if a simulation configuration is currently open *and*
        this configuration is **dirty** (i.e., has unsaved changes).

        Deserialize the passed low-level YAML-formatted simulation configuration

        Design
        ----------
        Although low-level, this method is publicly accessible to permit the
        :class:`QBetseeMainWindow` class to handle the equally low-level
        ``--sim-conf-number`` command-line option.

        Note that, to avoid conflicts and confusion with ``open`` methods
        declared throughout the Qt API (e.g., :meth:`QDialog.open`,
        :meth:`QFile.open`), this method is intentionally *not* named ``open``.

        Parameters
        ----------
        conf_filename : str
            Absolute path of this file.

        Write all unsaved changes for the currently open simulation
        configuration to the external YAML-formatted file underlying this
        configuration if such a configuration is open, if this configuration is
        dirty (i.e., has unsaved changes), and if the user interactively
        confirms the overwriting of the existing contents of this file.

        Design
        ----------
        Although low-level, this method is publicly accessible to permit the
        :class:`QBetseeMainWindow` class to handle unsaved changes on window
        closure events.

        This method should typically be called immediately *before* the
        currently open simulation configuration (if any) is closed, preventing
        unsaved changes from being irrevocably lost.

        Returns
        ----------
        bool
            Either:

            * ``False`` only if a configuration is open, this configuration is
              dirty, and the user cancels the dialog prompting for
              confirmation.  In this case, the caller should ideally abort the
              current operation (e.g., closure of either the current window or
              simulation configuration).
            * ``True`` in *all* other cases.
