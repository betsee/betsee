#FIXME: Shutdown gracefully. Currently, shutting the application down tends to
#yield non-deterministic segfaults. Note that properly implementing a graceful
#shutdown procedure is surprisingly non-trivial. As a useful starting point,
#consider the shutdown() and _shutdown() methods of the following submodule:
#    https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/blob/master/qutebrowser/app.py
#
#In particular, note the need to:
#
#* Uninstall all event filters and message handlers (i.e., reset these
#  callbacks to their defaults).
#* Use one-shot timers to increase the likelihood of a graceful shutdown.

#FIXME: Dynamically validate the importability of *ALL* PySide2 C extensions
#required by this application. Currently, we do so with simplistic exception
#handling. However, upstream recently noted that:
#
#    - added a way to dynamically detect the available Qt modules in Pyside
#
#What, exactly, is this "way"? If undocumented, let's file an issue requesting
#clarification. First grep the issue tracker for "detect module".

#FIXME: To simplify future localization efforts, all human-readable strings to
#be displayed should be filtered through the Qt tr() or translate() methods.
#Note that the external "pyside2-lupdate" command will probably need to be
#called to convert raw translation files into importable Python modules. For
#further details, see the following PySide-specific articles:
#
#* "Internationalisation of PyQt5 Applications." (Superb article.
#  Unsurprisingly, this is the canonical resource for PySide translations, which
#  conforms to the exact same API and hence suffers similar issues.)
#  http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt5/i18n.html
#* "Internationalizing PySide programs." (Crude ELI5 on PySide translations.
#  Insufficient in many respects, but a tolerable introduction to the subject.)
#  https://wiki.qt.io/PySide_Internationalization
#
#Generic Qt articles pertaining to this topic additionally include:
#
#* "Writing Source Code for Translation." (Superb "Qt Assistant" article.)
#* "Qt Linguist Manual: Translators." (Useful "Qt Linguist" usage instructions.)
#  https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/linguist-translators.html
#FIXME: Sadly, the behaviour of the "pyside2-lupdate" command is fairly awkward.
#Unlike the remainder of the PySide2 ecosystem, this command requires a ".pro"
#file whose syntax appears to superficially resemble that of traditional *nix
#makefiles. In turn, this file requires the absolute or relative path to the
#Python... *WAIT.* No, all is well. The ".pro" support is largely vestigial and
#only required for projects *NOT* already providing one or more ".ui" files.
#Fortunately, "pyside2-lupdate" supports both. *WAIT.* O.K.; so, we'll have
#translatable strings residing in:
#
#* Our ".ui" files. These files are guaranteed to be convertible into ".ts"
#  files which may then be translated via the "Qt Linguist" GUI, like so:
#
#    pyside2-lupdate \
#        ~/py/betsee/data/ui/betsee.ui -ts \
#        ~/py/betsee/data/ts/en_US.ts \
#        ~/py/betsee/data/ts/ru_RU.ts   # ...and so on for all needed languages.
#
#* All ".py" files under the ~/py/betsee/betsee/gui/widget/ subdirectory that
#  may contain dynamic calls to the tr() and translate() methods. In theory,
#  these files should also be convertible into ".ts" files which may then be
#  translated via the "Qt Linguist" GUI by recursively finding all such files in
#  pure-Python and then passing the absolute paths of these files in the same
#  manner:
#
#    pyside2-lupdate \
#        ~/py/betsee/betsee/gui/widget/guimainwindow.py \
#        ~/py/betsee/betsee/gui/widget/guisimconftree.py \
#        # ...and so on, recursively.
#        -ts \
#        ~/py/betsee/data/ts/en_US.ts \
#        ~/py/betsee/data/ts/ru_RU.ts   # ...and so on for all needed languages.
#
#  If passing ".py" files directly to "pyside2-lupdate" fails, we'll then need
#  to dynamically generate (and probably cache) a ".pro" file listing the paths
#  of these files, which may then be passed to "pyside2-lupdate" directly. See
#  "pyside2-lupdate --help" for a terse usage synopsis.
#
#Note that ".ts" files are *NOT* usable as is by Qt and hence by PySide2. Such
#files are only intended to be consumed and modified by the "Qt Linguist" GUI.
#Qt and hence PySide2 requires ".ts" files be converted to corresponding ".qm"
#(i.e., [Q]t [M]essage) files by either:
#
#* Manually selecting "File" -> "Release" in the "Qt Linguist" GUI.
#* Programmatically running the "lrelease" command.
#
#Naturally, we overwhelmingly prefer the latter approach -- or we would, at
#least, if the "lrelease" command were distributed as a mandatory core Qt
#component. It's not, which admittedly makes sense. While most Linux
#distributions do provide "lrelease" packages, there's little sense in adding
#yet another runtime dependency to this application... Hmm. Or maybe there is?
#
#O.K., I fully admit: I strongly prefer programmatically running the "lrelease"
#command at runtime and caching the resulting ".qm" files into
#"~/.betse/betsee/qm/" (e.g., "~/.betse/betsee/qm/en_US.qm"). Since translations
#are technically optional, we should simply make "lrelease" an optional
#dependency. Specifically:
#
#* If the "lrelease" command is pathable, the ".qm" target file specific to the
#  current system local should be automatically generated from the corresponding
#  ".ts" source file and cached into the "~/.betse/betsee/qm/" subdirectory.
#* Else, translations are ignored and a non-fatal warning should be issued.
#
#Assuming ".qm" files to be generated and cached in this fashion, we should then
#be able to leverage application-wide translations by adding the following
#initialization functionality to our existing "betsee.util.psdapp" submodule:
#
#    from PySide2.QtCore import QLocale, QTranslator
#
#    app_translator = QTranslator()
#
#    # Obviously, replace "~/.betse/betsee/qm" with the corresponding metadata.
#    #
#    # Perhaps more importantly, this should be strictly optional. Hence, any
#    # exception raised by this call should be converted into a non-fatal logged
#    # warning or (probably) error message. Does Qt provide a means beforehand
#    # of testing whether this ".qm" file exists? I suppose we can just manually
#    # concatenate this file's absolute path ourselves and test for the
#    # existance of this file. Hey, whatever works -- right?
#    app_translator.load(QLocale.system().name(), "~/.betse/betsee/qm")
#
#    get_app().installTranslator(app_translator)
#
#There exists one last minefield: the QObject.tr() versus
#QCoreApplication::translate() split. Basically:
#
#* The QObject.tr() instance method provides a more convenient interface that
#  (unfortunately) is broken by design.
#* QCoreApplication::translate() class method provides a less convenient
#  interface that actually behaves as intended.
#
#Riverbank themselves strongly recommend that QCoreApplication::translate()
#rather than QObject.tr() *ALWAYS* be called. For example, see
#http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt5/i18n.html:
#
#"The PyQt5 behaviour is unsatisfactory and may be changed in the future. It is
# recommended that translate() be used in preference to tr(). This is guaranteed
# to work with current and future versions of PyQt5 and makes it much easier to
# share message files between Python and C++ code."
#
#PySide2 is, of course, no different. To compound matters, the "pyside2-lupdate"
#command appears to have difficulty properly associating QObject.tr() calls with
#their appropriate context. For example, see this StackOverflow response:
#    https://stackoverflow.com/a/41174550/2809027
#
#One final caveat exists: interpolated arguments should be explicitly rather
#than implicitly numbered (e.g., "{0}" rather than "{}"). Why? Because
#non-English languages may interpolate arguments in a different order, in which
#case implicitly numbered {}-style arguments would not be translatable. For a
#real-world example demonstrating this difference between two English and
#Norwegian sentences, see the "Using Numbered Arguments" subsection of the
#"Writing Source Code for Translation" Qt article.
#
#Lastly, note that our application would still benefit from a way of permitting
#the user to explicitly define their interface language of choice. Technically,
#automatic locale detection should suffice for now. The appropriate
#documentation reads:
#
#    "Qt notifies applications if the user interface language changes by sending
#     an event of the type QEvent::LanguageChange. To call the member function
#     retranslateUi() of the user interface object, we reimplement
#     QWidget::changeEvent() in the form class, as follows:
#
#     void CalculatorForm::changeEvent(QEvent *e)
#     {
#         QWidget::changeEvent(e);
#         switch (e->type()) {
#         case QEvent::LanguageChange:
#             ui->retranslateUi(this);
#             break;
#         default:
#             break;
#        }
#     }
#
#tl;dr
#=====
#Always call QCoreApplication::translate() and explicitly number interpolated
#arguments (e.g., "{0}" rather than "{}"). To do so, a minimal-length example:
#
#    import sys
#    from QtCore import QCoreApplication
#
#    class MuhObject(QtCore.QObject):
#        def hello(self):
#            return QCoreApplication.translate(
#                'MuhObject', 'Muh hello world, {0}!'.format(sys.argv[0])
#
#Hence, calling QCoreApplication.translate() requires that the first parameter
#be the explicit name of the desired context -- which, for parity with C++,
#should *ALWAYS* be the name of the custom class performing this call.
#
#Annnnnnd we are done.
