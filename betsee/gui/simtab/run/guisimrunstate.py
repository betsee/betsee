'''
Set of all **out-bound fluid simulator states** (i.e., states the simulator may
freely transition from into any other state).

Specifically, the states:

* Contained in this set are all low priority and hence may be flexibly replaced
  at simulator runtime with any other state.
* Excluded by this set are all high priority and hence *must* be preserved as
  is until completed -- possibly by manual user intervention (e.g., toggling
  the start and pause buttons).

Caveats
----------
Technically, the claims implied by this set are *not* actually all the case.
For example, the simulator may transition from the:

* :attr:`SimmerState.UNQUEUED` state to *only* the
  :attr:`SimmerState.QUEUED` state.
* :attr:`SimmerState.QUEUED` state to *only* the
  :attr:`SimmerState.UNQUEUED`,
  :attr:`SimmerState.MODELLING`, and
  :attr:`SimmerState.EXPORTING` states.

Pragmatically, preserving these distinctions would incur more cost than
pretending these states may be freely transitioned from. We prefer the latter.

'''
Dictionary mapping from each type of simulator state to an object specific to
that type transitively yielding a human-readable, translated, unformatted
string templating the single-sentence details of the action being performed in
that state.

Structure
----------
Whereas each value of each key-value pair of the comparable
:data:`SIMMER_STATE_TO_PHASE_STATUS` and
:data:`SIMMER_STATE_TO_PROACTOR_STATUS` dictionaries is *always* a string,
each value of each key-value pair of this dictionary contextually depends upon
that value. Specifically, if this key is:

* :attr:`SimmerState.MODELLING`, this value is a nested dictionary mapping from
  each type of simulation phase to either:

  * If that phase is the seed phase, ``None``. Due to the variability of
    details pertaining to this phase, BETSE itself defines these details by the
    :meth:`betsee.gui.simtab.run.work.guisimrunworksig.SimCallbacksSignaller.progress_stated`
    method emitting a signal connected to the text box showing these details.
  * If that phase is the initialization or simulation phase, a nested
    dictionary mapping from each type of simulator modelling state to an
    unformatted string template detailing the current action being performed in
    that state.

* :attr:`SimmerState.EXPORTING`, this value is a nested dictionary mapping from
  each type of simulation export to an unformatted string template detailing
  the exporting of that export.
* Any other key, this value is an unformatted string template.

Formats
----------
Format specifiers embedded in these strings include:

* ``{progress_current}``, a non-negative integer signifying the current time
  step of this phase.
* ``{progress_total}``, a non-negative integer signifying the total number of
  time steps in this phase.

Most such strings contain no format specifiers and are thus displayable as is.
Some such strings contain one or more format specifiers (e.g., ``{cmd_name}}`)
and are thus displayable *only* after interpolating the corresponding values.
