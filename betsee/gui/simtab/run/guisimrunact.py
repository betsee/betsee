    '''
    High-level **simulator proactor** (i.e., :mod:`PySide2`-based object
    controlling but *not* displaying the execution of simulation phases).

    This proactor maintains all state needed to manage these phases, including:

    * A queue of all simulation subcommands to be interactively run.
    * Whether or not a simulation subcommand is currently being run.
    * The state of the currently run simulation subcommand (if any), including:

      * Visualization (typically, Vmem animation) of the most recent step
        completed for this subcommand.
      * Textual status describing this step in human-readable language.
      * Numeric progress as a relative function of the total number of steps
        required by this subcommand.

    Design
    ----------
    This proactor implements the well-known `proactor design pattern`_, whereby
    each simulation subcommand is asynchronously run by a simulator worker
    assigned to a pooled thread dedicated to that worker. This pattern is
    effectively an asynchronous variant of the `reactor design pattern`_.

    For maintainability, this proactor subsumes *all* roles defined by this
    pattern except the core role of the **asynchronous operation** (e.g., work
    performed by each worker), including the following roles:

    * **Proactive initiator** (i.e., the highest-level parent object
      responsible for governing all asynchronous activity).
    * **Asynchronous operation processor** (i.e., the second-highest-level
      parent object responsible for starting the asynchronous activity and
      forwarding responsibility for handling its completion to the completion
      dispatcher).
    * **Completion dispatcher** (i.e., the second-lowest-level child object
      responsible for receiving control from the asynchronous operation
      processor on the completion of the asynchronous activity and forwarding
      responsibility for handling its completion to the completion handler).
    * **Completion handler** (i.e., the lowest-level child object responsible
      for handling the actual completion of the asynchronous activity).

       https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_pattern

    Caveats
    ----------
    For simplicity, this proactor internally assumes the active Python
    interpreter to prohibit Python-based multithreading via a Global
    Interpreter Lock (GIL). Specifically, all worker-centric attributes (e.g.,
    :attr:`_worker`, :attr:`_workers_queued`) are assumed to be implicitly
    synchronized despite access to these attributes *not* being explicitly
    locked behind a Qt-based mutual exclusion primitive.

    GIL-less Python interpreters violate this simplistic assumption. For
    example, the :meth:`stop_workers` and :meth:`_handle_worker_completion`
    slots suffer obvious (albeit unlikely) race conditions under GIL-less
    interpreters due to competitively deleting the same underlying worker in a
    desynchronized and hence non-deterministic manner.

    Yes, this is assuredly a bad idea. Yes, this is us nonchalantly shrugging.

        manner, reverting the simulator to the idle state... **by any means
        necessary.**

        This high-level method subsumes the lower-level :meth:`stop_workers`
        slot by (in order):

        #. If no worker is currently working, silently reducing to a noop.
        #. Attempting to gracefully halt the currently working worker, dequeue
           all subsequently queued workers if any, and unblock this worker's
           parent thread if currently blocked.
        #. If this worker fails to gracefully halt within a reasonable window
           of time (e.g., 30 seconds), coerce this worker to immediately halt.

        Design
        ----------
        This method *must* called at application shutdown (e.g., by the parent
        main window). If this is not done *and* a previously running simulator
        worker is currently paused and hence indefinitely blocking its parent
        thread, this application will itself indefinitely block rather than
        actually shutdown. Which, of course, would be catastrophic.

        Caveats
        ----------
        This method may induce data loss or corruption in simulation output.
        In theory, this should only occur in edge cases in which the current
        simulator worker fails to gracefully stop within a sensible window of
        time. In practice, this implies that this method should *only* be
        called when otherwise unavoidable (e.g., at application shutdown).

        This method perform the equivalent of the body of the abstract loop
        iteratively starting and running all enqueued simulator workers.
        Specifically, this method iteratively starts the next simulator worker

        Ideally, the body of this method would be the body of a simple loop

        iteratively signalled by Qt on the completion of each worker, however,
        "rolling" this method into a loop is effectively infeasible.

        Technically, refactoring this method into a continuation-based
        generator would probably suffice to "roll" this method into a loop.
        Doing so, however, would require the use of an asynchronous
        Python-based event loop *and* a heavyweight architectural redesign. In

        Slot signalled on the currently running simulator worker erroneously

        This slot trivially handles this exception by re-raising this
        exception.  Since the only means of explicitly re-raising an exception
        exposed by Python 3.x is to encapsulate that exception inside another

        ----------
        exception : Exception
            Exception raised by this worker.

        Raises
        ----------
