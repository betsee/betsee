    Enumeration of all supported types of **simulator state** (i.e., mutually
    exclusive combination of one or more booleans uniquely capturing the
    condition of the currently queued simulation subcommand if any, analogous
    to a state in a finite state automata).

    Attributes
    ----------
    UNQUEUED : enum
        **Unqueued state,** implying no subcommands to be queued.
    QUEUED : enum
        **Queued state,** implying one or more subcommands to be queued but
        *not* yet run and hence neither paused, halted, nor done.
    MODELLING : enum
        **Modelling state,** implying one or more queued subcommands specific
        to modelling (e.g., seed, initialization) to be currently running and
        hence neither paused, halted, nor done.
    EXPORTING : enum
        **Exporting state,** implying one or more queued subcommands specific
        to exporting (e.g., seed exports, initialization exports) to be
        currently running and hence neither paused, halted, nor done.
    PAUSED : enum
        **Paused state,** implying one or more queued subcommands to have been
        run but paused before completion.
    STOPPING : enum
        **Stopping state,** implying one or more queued subcommands to have
        been run but manually stopped before completion. This is a temporary
        state during which the proactor waits for the previously running worker
        to gracefully stop. Until this worker does so, the proactor remains
        incapable of performing new work (i.e., running queued subcommands).
        After this worker gracefully stops, the proactor switches from this
        state into the :attr:`FINISHED` state, implying the proactor to be
        capable of performing new work.
    FINISHED : enum
        **Completion state,** implying all queued subcommands to have completed
        either:

        * Successfully, in which case those subcommands ran to completion.
        * Unsuccessfully, in which case either:

          * The user prematurely stopped some or all of those subcommands.
          * One of those subcommands raised an uncaught fatal exception.

SimmerModelState = make_enum(
    class_name='SimmerModelState',
    member_names=(
        'PREPARING',
        'MODELLING',
        'FINISHING',
    ),
    doc='''
    Enumeration of all supported types of **simulator modelling state** (i.e.,
    mutually exclusive boolean uniquely capturing the condition of the
    currently queued modelling simulation subcommand if any, analogous to a
    state in a finite state automata).

    This enumeration applies *only* when the proactor is currently modelling
    (i.e., when the state of the proactor is :attr:`SimmerState.MODELLING`).
    This enumeration generically applies to modelling all simulation phases,
    including the seed, initialization, and simulation phases of a simulation.
    That said, this enumeration is typically only used to describe simulation
    phases whose modelling entails time steps -- notably, the initialization
    and simulation (but *not* seed) phases.

    Attributes
    ----------
    PREPARING : enum
        **Pre-processing state.** When modelling the initialization and
        simulation (but *not* seed) phases, this state implies a proactor
        worker to be preparing to model the first time step of this phase but
        to have yet to actually do so.
    MODELLING : enum
        **In-processing state.** When modelling the initialization and
        simulation (but *not* seed) phases, this state implies a proactor
        worker to be modelling a time step of this phase.
    FINISHING : enum
        **Post-processing state,** implying a proactor worker to:

        * Have successfully modelled all time steps of this phase.
        * Now be saving the results of this phase to disk, typically as one or
          more Python-specific pickled files.
