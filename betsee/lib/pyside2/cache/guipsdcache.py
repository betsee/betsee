    Enumeration of all supported types of **cache policy** (i.e., procedure for
    generating and reusing pure-Python submodules from their input
    XML-formatted files at application runtime).

    Attributes
    ----------
    AUTO : enum
        **Automatic cache policy.** When enabled, this policy defers to either
        the :attr:`DEV` or :attr:`USER` cache policies conditionally depending
        on whether this application is currently under developer-specific
        version control or not. Specifically:

        * If this application has a **Git-based working tree** (i.e., top-level
          directory containing this application's ``.git`` subdirectory and
          ``setup.py`` install script), this application is assumed to have
          been installed for developer usage. In this case, the :attr:`DEV`
          cache policy is deferred to.
        * Else, this application is assumed to have been installed for end user
          usage. In this case, the :attr:`USER` cache policy is deferred to.
    DEV : enum
        **Developer cache policy.** When enabled, application-wide submodules
        (e.g., :meth:`betsee.guimetaapp.BetseeMetaApp.data_py_qrc_filename`)
        are generated and copied over all equivalent user-specific submodules
        (e.g., :meth:`betsee.guimetaapp.BetseeMetaApp.dot_py_qrc_filename`),
        guaranteeing the latter to *always* exist. Exceptions raised while
        doing so are treated as fatal.
    USER : enum
        **End user cache policy.** When enabled, only user-specific submodules
        are generated. Application-wide submodules are commonly installed into
        system directories unwritable by end users (e.g.,
        ``/usr/lib64/python3.6/site-packages/betsee/data/py``). Ergo, this
        policy *never* attempts to regenerate these submodules. If an exception
        is raised when regenerating a user-specific submodule:

        * This exception is treated as non-fatal and hence merely logged rather
          than prematurely halting the active Python process.
        * The corresponding application-wide submodule is copied over that
          user-specific submodule, guaranteeing the latter to *always* exist.

    submodules due to petty ownership or permission conflicts) should be
    confined to this function rather than halting the entire application.
