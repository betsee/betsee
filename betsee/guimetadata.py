Design
----------
**This string must be prefixed by the minimum version of BETSE required by this
application.** Equivalently, this string must be of the form
``{betse_version}.{patch_version}`, where:

* ``{betse_version}`` is the minimum required version of BETSE.
* ``{patch_version}`` is the current patch number of this application with
  respect to this version of BETSE.

For example, if this is the second iteration of this application to require at
least BETSE 0.8.5, this version is expected to be ``0.8.5.2``.

This is *not* merely a style convention; this is a hard prerequisite. Why?
Because this string is parsed elsewhere (e.g., the `:mod:`betsee.guimetadeps`
submodule) to produce a setuptools-specific dependency on this BETSE version.
Failure to conform to this specification will induce user dependency hell at
both distribution and installation time, which is (rather) bad.

DESCRIPTION = (

    'official Qt 5-based graphical user interface (GUI) for BETSE, a '
    'finite volume simulator for 2D computational multiphysics problems in '
    'the life sciences -- including electrodiffusion, electro-osmosis, '

    'and biochemical reaction networks.'

Human-readable multiline description of this application.

By :mod:`argparse` design, this string may (and typically should) span both
multiple lines and paragraphs. Note that this string is *not* published to
PyPI, which accepts reStructuredText (rst) and is thus passed the contents of
the top-level :doc:`/README` file instead.

URL of the source tarball for the current version of this application.

This URL assumes a tag whose name is ``v{VERSION}`` where ``{VERSION}`` is the
human-readable current version of this application (e.g., ``v0.4.0``) to exist.
Typically, no such tag exists for live versions of this application -- which
have yet to be stabilized and hence tagged. Hence, this URL is typically valid
*only* for previously released (rather than live) versions of this application.
