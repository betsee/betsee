    (Re-)initialize this application -- but *not* mandatory third-party
    dependencies of this application, which requires external resources (e.g.,
    command-line options, configuration files) to be parsed.

    Specifically, this function (in order):

    #. Initializes all lower-level BETSE logic by calling the
       :func:`betse.ignition.init` function.
    #. Validates but does *not* initialize mandatory third-party dependencies of
       this application, which must be initialized independently by the
       :func:`betsee.lib.guilib.init` function.
    #. Validates the active Python interpreter to support multithreading.

    Design
    ----------
    To support caller-specific error handling, this function is intended to be
    called immediately *after* this application begins catching otherwise
    uncaught exceptions.

    Whereas BETSE is intended to be both run non-interactively from the
    command-line and imported interactively from Python REPLs (e.g., Jupyter),
    BETSEE is intended to only be run non-interactively from desktop application
    launchers. In the former case, BETSE detects and ignores attempts to
    re-initialize itself in the same application process. In the latter case, no
    re-initialization is expected, detected, or ignored.

    #
    # These dependencies are intentionally *NOT* initialized here (e.g., by
    # calling guilib.init()), as doing so requires the logging configuration to
    # have been finalized (e.g., by parsing CLI options), which has yet to
    # occur this early in the application lifecycle.
